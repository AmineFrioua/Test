% Read an image to do the noise test on it 
%in this case the test.png is an image from Matlab defualts picture you can upload any picture and test it 
image = imread('test.png');
% convert the image from a RBG colored image into a grayscaled image (2 version one origian and one we will modify)
A = rgb2gray(image);
I = rgb2gray(image);
% get the dimension of the image 
[r,c]=size(I);

%we go through each pixel ( we avoid pixels on the border of the picture )
for i = 2:r-1
    for j = 2:c-1
        % get the value of the tested pixel
        pixel= I(i,j);
        % store the average value of the surrounding four pixels brightness
        moy = (I(i-1,j)+I(i,j-1)+I(i+1,j)+I(i,j+1))/4;
        % test if it is too different(noise test)
        if( pixel-moy> 10) || (moy-pixel>  10)
