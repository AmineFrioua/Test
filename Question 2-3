Question 2-1 : 
The Pros:
-The loop of the treatment and the test is simple and does not require a lot of coding, simple to process 
-Require a small amount of memory 
The Cons:
-We involve in the testing process only 4 pixels surrounding a tested pixel 
-less accuracy in detecting nosie 
 
Question 2-2:
The Pros:
-Involving all the surrounding pixels in the testing process of a tested pixels
-More accuracy and efficiency in detecting noise 
-Replacing the pixel that contains noise is more compatible pixel 
The Cons:
-The loop of the treatment is more complexe and contain an extra function (sorting function to sort the pixels surround the tested pixel)
-More coding lines thus more memory allocation for this program.
